## `Introduction`
Welcome to the collaboration project for building an admin panel to manage users. This project aims to create a user-friendly interface for administrators to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user accounts.

## `Project Overview`
The admin panel will include the following features:
- **Authentication**: Secure login system for administrators.

- **User Management**:
  - `Add new users:` Administrators can create new user accounts.
  - `Read user details:` Administrators can view the details of existing users.
  - `Update user information:` Administrators can modify user details.
  - `Delete users:` Administrators can remove user accounts from the system.
- **Permissions**: Implementing role-based access control to define different levels of access for administrators.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
- **Backend**:
  - Server-side scripting language (Node.js, Python, PHP)
  - Database management system (MongoDB)
- **Authentication**:
  - Authentication library or framework (e.g., JWT, OAuth)
- **Security**:
  - Implementing security best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection)
